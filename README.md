# PalindroneCheckerApp
PalindromeChecker is a simple and efficient application that determines whether a given word, phrase, or number is a palindrome — meaning it reads the same forward and backward (e.g., “madam”, “racecar”, “121”). The app processes user input by removing spaces, punctuation, and letter casing differences to ensure accurate and reliable results.

Designed with clean code and ease of use in mind, PalindromeChecker provides a fast and lightweight solution for testing palindromes. It can be used as a learning project, a utility tool, or a foundation for further enhancements such as a graphical interface, web integration, or API development.
