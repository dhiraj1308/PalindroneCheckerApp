In This Java application, UseCase4PalindromeCheckerApp, implements a memory-efficient palindrome validation tool using the two-pointer technique. By converting the input string into a character array and simultaneously comparing characters from both ends (start and end pointers) moving toward the center, the program determines symmetry without the need for additional string reversal or temporary storage. This version represents a significant optimization over previous iterations by reducing memory overhead and allowing for early-exit logic as soon as a character mismatch is detected.
