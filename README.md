# PalindromeCheckerApp
This Java application demonstrates fundamental string manipulation and comparison logic by validating whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome. Following the design requirements for Use Case 2, the program stores a predefined string and determines its status by comparing characters from both ends. This approach serves as a foundational exercise in algorithm design, introducing basic data validation techniques before transitioning to more complex data structures.
The implementation is optimized for performance by utilizing a for loop that iterates only until the halfway point of the string's length. During each iteration, the character at index i is compared against its corresponding character at the end of the string. If a mismatch occurs, the program immediately identifies the string as a non-palindrome and terminates the loop, ensuring an efficient and logical determination of the string's properties.
