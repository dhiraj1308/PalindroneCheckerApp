This Java application validates whether a given string is a palindrome by leveraging the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) property of a Stack data structure. The program first populates a stack by pushing each character of the input string onto it, which effectively places the characters in reverse order relative to the top of the stack. By subsequently popping these characters and comparing them one-by-one against the original sequence, the application can determine if the string reads the same forward and backward.
The implementation follows a structured process: initializing the input, pushing characters into the stack, and then iterating through the string again to verify equality against the popped values. If all characters match their reversed counterparts, the string is confirmed as a palindrome and the result is displayed to the console. This maps stack behavior directly to reversal logic, providing an efficient way to demonstrate fundamental data structure principles in Java.
