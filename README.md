This project is a Java application that demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern by implementing a flexible palindrome-checking utility. It defines a central PalindromeStrategy interface, allowing different validation algorithms to be dynamically injected and executed at runtime. The current implementation features a StackStrategy, which leverages a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack data structure to reverse the characters of an input string and verify if it reads the same forwards and backwards. The primary focus of this codebase is to illustrate extensible software design and algorithm interchangeability, providing a foundation where new palindrome-checking methods can be easily added without modifying the core application logic.
