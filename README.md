Project Overview:
The UseCase6PalindromeCheckerApp is a specialized Java application that demonstrates how to identify palindromes by leveraging the unique behaviors of Stacks and Queues. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards, and this program validates that symmetry by comparing two distinct data representations of the input string. It serves as a practical academic exercise for understanding how LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) processing can be combined to solve complex string manipulation problems.
How It Works:
The application operates by simultaneously inserting each character of a user-provided string into both a Stack and a Queue. Because a Queue retrieves items in their original order while a Stack retrieves them in reverse, the program can verify symmetry by popping elements from both structures and comparing them one by one. If every pair of characters matches throughout the entire sequence, the string is confirmed as a palindrome; otherwise, the program immediately identifies it as non-palindromic.
