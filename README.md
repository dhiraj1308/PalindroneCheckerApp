Project Overview:
The UseCase7PalindromeCheckerApp is a specialized Java application designed to determine if a given string is a palindrome—a sequence that reads the same forward and backward. Unlike traditional methods that reverse the entire string, this implementation focuses on a Deque-based approach to optimize character comparison. By treating the input as a bidirectional sequence, the program can efficiently evaluate symmetry from both ends simultaneously, making it an ideal demonstration of practical data structure application in string analysis.
Implementation Logic:
The core of this application leverages the Java Deque interface to store characters in a double-ended queue. During execution, each character of the processed input is added to the rear of the deque. The validation process then iteratively removes and compares the first and last elements using removeFirst() and removeLast(). If at any point the characters from opposing ends do not match, the string is immediately flagged as not a palindrome, ensuring a highly efficient O(n) time complexity for detection.
