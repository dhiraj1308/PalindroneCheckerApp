Project Overview: UC11 Palindrome Service
The UseCase11PalindromeCheckerApp is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through a practical string manipulation utility. By decoupling the core validation logic from the execution layer, the project showcases how encapsulation allows for cleaner, more professional code structures. The application serves as a foundational example of how to transition from simple procedural scripts to scalable, service-oriented architectures.
The technical core of the system resides within the PalindromeService class, which utilizes an efficient two-pointer comparison algorithm. This approach processes strings in image.gif
time complexity by comparing characters from both ends moving toward the center, ensuring high performance even with longer text inputs. To improve reliability, the service includes data sanitization steps, such as character normalization and case conversion, which prevent false negatives caused by formatting inconsistencies like capitalization or spacing.
By implementing this specific structure, the project achieves a high degree of modularity and reusability. Because the palindrome logic is isolated in a dedicated service class, it can be easily integrated into larger software systems or web APIs without modifying the underlying validation code. This separation of concerns not only makes the codebase easier to debug and maintain but also adheres to industry standards for clean code and professional software development practices.
