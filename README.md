This LinkedList-based Palindrome Checker is a Java application designed to validate string symmetry by leveraging the double-ended capabilities of a LinkedList. The program populates the list with characters from a user-provided string and uses the removeFirst() and removeLast() methods to compare elements from both ends simultaneously. This approach efficiently demonstrates how linear data structures can be used for symmetric validation and algorithmic processing.
To use the application, compile the UseCaseBPalindromeCheckerApp.java file and run it using any standard Java environment (JDK 8+). Upon execution, simply enter a word or phrase into the console; the program will normalize the input by ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters, then output whether the entry is a palindrome. It serves as a practical example of UC8: Linked List Based logic for developers and students alike.
